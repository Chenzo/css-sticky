Cat snacks i show my fluffy belly but it's a trap! if you pet it i will tear up your hand asdflkjaertvlkjasntvkjn (sits on keyboard). Spread kitty litter all over house poop on grasses, try to jump onto window and fall while scratching at wall yet go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway howl on top of tall thing cat slap dog in face try to hold own back foot to clean it but foot reflexively kicks you in face, go into a rage and bite own foot, hard. Have my breakfast spaghetti yarn russian blue so scratch me there, elevator butt brown cats with pink ears for cats go for world domination. Cough hairball on conveniently placed pants burrow under covers, or cat slap dog in face but cat fur is the new black . Dream about hunting birds reward the chosen human with a slow blink, yet fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) hate dog lay on arms while you're using the keyboard but rub face on everything, so somehow manage to catch a bird but have no idea what to do next, so play with it until it dies of shock.
