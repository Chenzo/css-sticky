<p>Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.</p>
<p>I just told you! You've killed me! Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.</p>
<p>I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Who am I making this out to? Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Who are those horrible orange men?</p>
<p>I wish! It's a nickel. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."</p>
<p>Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". But I've never been to the moon! You're going to do his laundry? Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!</p>
<p>I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? No, I'm Santa Claus! Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?</p>
<p>Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. They're like sex, except I'm having them! OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?</p>
<p>Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! She also liked to shut up! Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.</p>

            <h2 class="stickme">Title Number Two</h2>
            <p>For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Why yes! Thanks for noticing. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Shinier than yours, meatbag.</p>
<p>Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? You wouldn't. Ask anyway! I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!</p>
<p>You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Ummm…to eBay? I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!</p>
<p>Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.</p>

            <h2 class="stickme">Words are hard to think of</h2>
            <p>I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? Bender, quit destroying the universe! Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.</p>
<p>Tell them I hate them. We don't have a brig. Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!</p>
<p>Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!</p>
<p>We don't have a brig. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Take me to your leader! One hundred dollars. I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!</p>
<p>Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.</p>
<p>Leela's gonna kill me. No argument here. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.</p>
<p>You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Look, last night was a mistake. Soon enough. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.</p>

            <h2 class="stickme">Stick Me In The middle</h2>
            <!-- start slipsum code -->

<p>You lived before you met me?! You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Is that a cooking show? We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.</p>
<p>Pansy. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! I just told you! You've killed me! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".</p>
<p>Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.</p>
<p>Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! It's toe-tappingly tragic! And then the battle's not so bad?</p>
<p>Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…</p>
<p>I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.</p>
<p>I love you, buddy! You mean while I'm sleeping in it? One hundred dollars. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</p>

            <h2 class="stickme">One more for good measure</h2>
            <!-- start slipsum code -->

<p>Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Bender?! You stole the atom. I don't want to be rescued. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Bender?! You stole the atom.</p>
<p>This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.</p>
<p>Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Why not indeed! Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Oh right. I forgot about the battle.</p>
<p>Oh God, what have I done? I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. It's a T. It goes "tuh". Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>
<p>She also liked to shut up! We're rescuing ya. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? I'll get my kit!</p>
<p>It must be wonderful. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Then we'll go with that data file! Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>
<p>Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Hey, whatcha watching?</p>
